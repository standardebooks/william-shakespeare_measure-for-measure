									<span>If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Servile to all the skyey influences,</span>

									<span>That dost this habitation, where thou keep’st,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death’s fool;</span>

									<br/>
									<span>And yet runn’st toward him still. Thou art not noble;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For all the accommodations that thou bear’st</span>

									<br/>
									<span>And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear’st</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;</span>

									<span>For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And what thou hast, forget’st. Thou art not certain;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>After the moon. If thou art rich, thou’rt poor;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thou bear’st thy heavy riches but a journey,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The mere effusion of thy proper loins,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But, as it were, an after-dinner’s sleep,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To make thy riches pleasant. What’s yet in this</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That bears the name of life? Yet in this life</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,</span>

This being granted in course⁠—and now follows all⁠—we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled.
